1 INTRODUCTION      
2 DEMAND AND SUPPLY - Done.      
3 ELASTICITIES OF DEMAND - Done.      
  -> 3.1 Price Elasticity of Demand       
  -> 3.2 Income Elasticity of Demand     
4 PROFIT AND COSTS OF PRODUCTION - Done         
  -> **Opportunity cost** : An opportunity cost is the value forgone by choosing a particular course of action relative to the best alternative that is not chosen.                  
  -> **law of diminishing returns** : The law of diminishing marginal returns states that adding an additional factor of production results in smaller increases in output.          

5 PRICING - In Progress.
