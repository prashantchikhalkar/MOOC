Interest is paid by the borrower to compensate the lender:
-> A for opportunity cost and risk.
B for forgoing future consumption.
C for increases in future purchasing power.

2 A company obtains a loan from a local bank for $50 million. From the company’s perspective, interest is best defined as the:
A risk of default.
-> B cost of borrowing.
C value of the next best alternative.

3 The greater the risk associated with a borrower’s ability to repay a loan, the greater the:
A opportunity cost for the borrower.
-> B interest rate demanded by the lender.
C risk of purchasing power increasing over the life of the loan.

4 To maintain purchasing power, lenders demand an interest rate that reflects the:
A likelihood of default.
-> B current rate of inflation.
--> C expected rate of inflation.

5 If interest is paid and compounded annually, the compound interest rate is most likely to be:
-> A higher than the simple interest rate.
--> B the same as the simple interest rate.
C lower than the simple interest rate.

6 Compared with compound interest, simple interest assumes that interest is:
A paid annually.
-> B calculated using only the original amount invested.
C reinvested and added to the original amount invested.

7 Which of the following is associated with the concept of interest on interest?
A Simple interest
-> B Compound interest
C Annual percentage rate

8 If $1,000 is deposited to an account with an annual interest rate of 3% and is left on deposit for three years, the amount of money in the account at the end of three years will be:
-> A lower using simple interest compared with using compound interest.
B the same using either simple interest or compound interest.
C greater using simple interest compared with using compound interest.

9 The interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows is called the:
--> A discount rate.
-> B effective annual rate.
C annual percentage rate.

10 The most effective way to compare investments with the same initial outflow that have different cash flows at different points in time is to determine each investment’s:
A discount rate.
--> B present value.
-> C future cash flows.

11 The present value of €100 that will be received two years from today is:
-> A less than €100.
B equal to €100.
C more than €100.

12 All else being equal, given a choice of when to pay for a purchase, an individual would most likely prefer to pay £100:
A today.
B one year from today.
-> C two years from today.

13 Assuming a discount rate of 10%, which of the following projects will have the highest present value?
-> A A €10,000 lump-sum payment received today
B A €10,000 lump-sum payment received in one year
C A €5,000 payment received today plus €5,000 to be received in one year

14 Given an interest rate of 10% and assuming that interest is reinvested, which of the following will have the highest future value?
A €10,000 invested today for 5 years.
B €10,000 invested today for 10 years.
-> C €10,000 invested today for 15 years.

15 When evaluating an investment, if the discount rate increases while holding all other factors constant, the present value will:
-> A increase.
--> B decrease.
C remain unchanged.

16 When choosing among investments that have different initial costs and future cash flows, the best choice is the investment with the highest:
A discount rate.
--> B net present value.
-> C present value of future cash flows.

17 Which of the following investments is unacceptable? An investment with a net present value of:
-> A negative $5.
B $0.
C positive $5.

18 If an individual makes an initial payment to an insurance company in exchange for a fixed number of future payments of a certain amount from the insurance company, the individual has:
A received a loan.
B obtained a mortgage.
-> C purchased an annuity.

19 In a mortgage transaction, the amount of each fixed payment made by the borrower that represents interest:
-> A decreases over time.
B remains the same over time.
C increases over time.

20 Which of the following is a measure of central tendency?
-> A Mean
B Range
C Standard deviation

21 If the data in a set are continuous and skewed, which of the following gives the best measure of central tendency?
A Mean
-> B Mode
--> C Median

22 The preferred measure of central tendency for investment returns is the:
A mode.
B arithmetic mean.
-> C geometric mean.

23 An analyst is comparing the returns of two investment portfolios. The two portfolios have the same mean return. The portfolio with the higher standard deviation most likely:
-> A is less risky.
--> B is more risky.
C has a smaller range.

24 Which of the following is a measure of dispersion?
A Mode
-> B Range
C Median

25 Which of the following is a measure of dispersion used to assess the risk of an investment?
A Arithmetic mean
B Geometric mean
-> C Standard deviation

26 Which of the following characteristics most likely represents a normal distribution?
-> A The values of the mean and median are identical.
B There are more observations to the right of the mean than to the left.
C There are more observations to the left of the mean than to the right.

27 A characteristic of a normal distribution is that the distribution of data is:
--> A symmetrical.
-> B positively skewed.
C negatively skewed.

28 For a normal distribution, the height and width of the distribution is determined by the distribution’s:
A mean.
B median.
-> C standard deviation.

29 If there is no relationship between two variables, the correlation coefficient is closest to:
A +1.
-> B 0.
C –1.

30 Assume the correlation between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate is close to –1. Based on this information, if the unemployment rate is expected to increase, then the inflation rate will most likely:
A increase.
-> B decrease.
C remain unchanged.
