Linux Kernel Fundamentals: Chapter 2, Booting

You need to get to the system console. Using virt-manager and a VM is a handy way to do this.

1. Run dmesg and look to see if each output line starts with a time stamp in the form of 
[     0.1234]. Reboot. From your system console, interrupt GRUB and add the option 
printk.time=1 to the kernel line (if you do not have a time stamp) or add printk.time=0 (if you 
do have a time stamp). Continue with the bootup. After booting, log in and see if dmesg output 
now looks different. Were time stamps added or are they gone?
Using https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Grub2, or another appropriate distro, make a custom GRUB 
entry that is the same as your current kernelâ€™s entry, but with some changes:
a. Make the title say Custom Linux Boot Entry.
b. Add the kernel command-line option initcall_debug to the end of the kernel line.
c. For your distro, determine the grub.cfg file to use, and then make a new one with 
  grub2-mkconfig. For example: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
d. Reboot, pick your new GRUB entry, and after it boots, grep initcall from the output of  
 dmesg.

2. Interrupt GRUB, and choose your original kernel entry. At the end of the vmlinuz line, add 
init=/bin/bash and boot. What happened? Turn the power off and on, interrupt GRUB again, and 
this time, put rdinit=/bin/sh at the end and boot. What happens now?
Reboot back into your full Linux environment.

3. Using pstree, can you determine which processes are direct descendants of PID 1?

4. Does your system have a program called init? Is init a soft link? Is PID 1 running init?
