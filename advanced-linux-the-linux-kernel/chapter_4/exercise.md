Linux Kernel Fundamentals: Chapter 4, Examining Linux Kernel Source Code
1. Fetch the kernel source as an RPM.
2. Fetch the Ubuntu kernel source.
3. For your kernel, do make cscope and make tags.
4. Look at the first few lines of Makefile. What kernel version is it? Does it match uname -r? In the 
kernel Makefile, set EXTRAVERSION to -<YOUR NAME>. For example: EXTRAVERSION = -kevin.
5. Test the ctags facility of the vi text editor.
• Look up the function in the Linux kernel called sys_open(). If you find macro definitions at 
first, do :tn to find the next definition, and until you find the function definition.
• The sys_open() function makes use of other functions. Move your cursor to one of these functions and hit Ctrl-]. What happened?
• Hit the key sequence Ctrl-T. What happened?
• Use the :tag command to look up the tag atomic_inc. Use the :tn command. What did 
this do? What does the :ts command do?
• Without changing directories, load the file 3c59x.c.
• Use the command :tags. What does this show?
